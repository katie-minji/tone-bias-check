# tone-bias-check
Check for tone bias during stage 1 among 2Hz and 8Hz. Check if the hitrates for the two tones are different. 


<< Instructions >>

Purpose: 
This code is use to check tone bias (2Hz vs 8Hz) in stage1 before the fear conditioning with the 2Hz tone. 
This code plots 3 subplots, [1: 2Hz null and hitrate], [2: 8Hz null and hitrate], [3: 2Hz and 8Hz hitrate comparison]

Batching == Possible!: (options) 
[1: by mouse --> e.g. wt871_N folder: all stage 1 training session file for wt871_N mouse], 
[2: specific session --> e.g. 09_21_2022___09_44_12 file: specific training session file in stage 1] --> can't get session!
--> additional instruction: change 'batch' on the first line of the code to 'y' (#1/2) or 'n' (#3)
